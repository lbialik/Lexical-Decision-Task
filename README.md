# Lexical-Decision-Task

These are the materials required to reproduce the Lexical Decision Experiment from Brian Dillon's Linguistics 412 class at UMass Amherst, Fall 2019. 

The PsychoPy materials folder contains the PsychoPy python file that runs the experiment, and the data_processor.py file contains the evaluation script, that takes in the results from the PsychoPy experiment, and returns the statistics.

In order to run this experiment, you will need to download PsychoPy. You can find the download link here: https://www.psychopy.org/download.html
